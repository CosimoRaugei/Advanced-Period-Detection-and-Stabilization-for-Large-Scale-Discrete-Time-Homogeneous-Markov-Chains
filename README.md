# Thesis Algorithms in C++, MATLAB, and Python

This repository contains the source code for two algorithms implemented in C++, MATLAB, and Python. These algorithms are part of my thesis on period stabilization.

## Algorithms:
1. **n Algorithm Period Stabilization**
   - `n_algorithm_period_stabilization.cpp`
   - `n_algorithm_period_stabilization.m`
   - `n_algorithm_period_stabilization.py`

2. **2n-1 Algorithm Period Stabilization**
   - `2n-1_algorithm_period_stabilization.cpp`
   - `2n-1_algorithm_period_stabilization.m`
   - `2n-1_algorithm_period_stabilization.py`

### View the Code in a Tabbed Interface:
