# Advanced Period Detection and Stabilization for Large-Scale Discrete-Time Homogeneous Markov Chains

This is an introduction to the ongoing undergraduate research project by Cosimo Raugei and Leonardo Torti, titled **"Advanced Period Detection and Stabilization for Large-Scale Discrete-Time Homogeneous Markov Chains."**

## Introduction

Period finding is a fundamental problem in understanding the long-term behavior for discrete-time homogeneous Markov chains. Identifying the period of such chains is essential for predicting stable states and recurrent behavior within the state space. However, as the scale of these Markov chains grows, determining periodicity becomes increasingly complex due to the size and intricacy of the state space and transition structure, creating a significant computational challenge in efficiently and accurately finding stable periodic behavior.

This project directly addresses this computational problem for large Markov chains, providing, to the best of our knowledge, a solution to a previously unsolved problem: finding the smallest integer \( n \) such that, beyond \( n \), the period does not decrease further and can thus be considered definitive. Our solution effectively stabilizes the period detection process for large-scale Markov chains, allowing for the reliable identification of stable periodic behavior across extensive and complex state spaces. 

## Techniques Used

The techniques and mathematics applied in this work draw from advanced areas of spectral analysis, graph theory, and number theory. 

## Matrix Dataset

To support numerical simulations and test additional hypotheses, this repository includes a rich dataset of matrices representing various types of Markov chains with complex transition dynamics. This dataset will be enriched as the research continues.
